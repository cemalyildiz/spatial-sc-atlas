# Spatial &amp; Single-Cell Atlas

A browsable, filterable catalog of **spatial transcriptomics** and **single-cell RNA-seq**
datasets for cancer and other diseases, harvested straight from
[NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
[EBI ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress).

**→ [cemalyildiz.github.io/spatial-sc-atlas-cld](https://cemalyildiz.github.io/spatial-sc-atlas-cld/)**

Built for the question "which public dataset should I actually use?" rather than for reading
abstracts. The filter that usually matters first is **imaging-based vs sequencing-based**, and the
records worth the most are the **paired** ones — a single deposit carrying both spatial and
single-cell data, which is what you need for deconvolution, label transfer and spot annotation.

## Filters

| Filter | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Modality | Paired (spatial + single-cell) · Spatial only · Single-cell only |

| Disease group | Cancer · Other disease · Unspecified |
| Disease / cancer type | NSCLC, SCLC, breast, colorectal, glioma/GBM, meningioma, pancreatic, melanoma, …, plus non-cancer categories (fibrosis, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, cardiovascular, …) |
| Subtype (multi-value) | LUAD, LUSC, LCNEC, TNBC, HER2-positive, luminal, ccRCC, CRPC, NEPC, ESCC, PDAC, HCC, DLBCL, B-ALL, T-ALL, CLL, MIBC, HGSOC, HNSCC, DIPG, plus molecular labels — EGFR-mutant, ALK-rearranged, KRAS-mutant, IDH-mutant, MSI-high, HPV-positive |
| Tissue / organ | Lung, brain/CNS, breast, colon/intestine, liver, kidney, … |
| Organism | Human · Mouse · Human &amp; Mouse |
| Source database | GEO · ArrayExpress |
| Access | Open · Controlled |
| Release year | Range |
| Minimum cells | ≥ 10k / 50k / 100k / 500k |

Filter state lives in the URL, so a filtered view is a shareable link. Results export as CSV or
JSON, and the accessions of the whole filtered set copy to the clipboard in one click — paste them
straight into a download script.

## Which fields are trustworthy

| Verbatim from the source database | Derived here, automatically |
| --- | --- |
| accession · title · description · organism · sample count · release date · PubMed ID | modality · platform · imaging vs sequencing · disease category · subtype · tissue · cell count |

Derived fields are pattern-matched from each record's title and description by the vocabularies at
the top of [`scripts/harvest.py`](scripts/harvest.py). They are good enough to filter and browse
with, and wrong often enough that you should open the source record — one click from every card —
before a dataset enters an analysis. A `Paired` badge means the record text mentions both a spatial
platform and single-cell data; it is a strong hint, not a guarantee that both live in the same series.

Improving a label means editing a regex in `harvest.py` and re-running the harvest — not hand-editing
`data/datasets.json`, which is regenerated on every run.

One rule when adding subtype patterns: short abbreviations collide. `ILC` is innate lymphoid cell
far more often than invasive lobular carcinoma, `IDC` is also interdigitating dendritic cell, `FL`
and `MCL` hit gene and cell-type names. Those are matched by full phrase only. Check a candidate
abbreviation against the existing catalog before adding it bare.

## How it stays current

`.github/workflows/refresh.yml` re-runs the harvest every Monday and opens a **pull request** when
the catalog changes, so nothing reaches the site without review.

```
Actions → Refresh catalog → Run workflow
  mode: pr      open a pull request for review  (default, used by the schedule)
  mode: direct  commit straight to main         (use for the first build)
```

Optionally add a repository secret `NCBI_API_KEY`
([get one here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/)) to raise the NCBI rate limit from
3 to 10 requests per second. The harvest works without it, just more slowly.

## Running the harvest locally

```bash
python3 scripts/harvest.py     # stdlib only, no dependencies
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then open http://localhost:8000
```

The harvest refuses to overwrite `data/datasets.json` if it comes back with fewer than 200 records,
so a half-finished network run cannot wipe the catalog.

## Layout

```
index.html            single-page app, no build step
assets/style.css      design tokens, light + dark
assets/app.js         filtering, comparison, charts — no dependencies
scripts/harvest.py    GEO + ArrayExpress harvest and classification
data/datasets.json    the catalog (generated; do not hand-edit)
data/meta.json        counts and the generation timestamp
```

## Citing

This site is an index, not a source. Cite the original study and its accession. Check each record's
terms of use before redistributing data — a few carry controlled access even where the metadata is
public.
